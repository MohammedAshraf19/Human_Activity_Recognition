## What_is_HAR_SYSTEM
The Human Activity Recognition System is an advanced solution designed to monitor and classify human activities using data from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. This system is particularly useful for elderly care, providing real-time activity recognition and fall detection to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals. The system includes a mobile application developed with Flutter, a machine learning model using XGBoost, and a backend built with Node.js.

## Overview

The IcareU HAR System employs Gyroscope and Accelerometer sensors to gather data, which is processed by machine learning algorithms to classify activities and detect falls. This system enhances elderly care by ensuring quick responses to emergencies and monitoring daily activities.

## Features

- **Activity Detection**: Utilizes Gyroscope and Accelerometer data to classify activities such as walking, sitting, standing, etc.

- **Fall Detection**: Detects sudden falls using sensor data and triggers alerts to notify caregivers.

- **Notification System**: Sends real-time notifications to mentors or caregivers via an integrated API for prompt response to detected falls or emergencies.

- **Medicine Reminders**: Enables setting medication reminders to manage the health of elderly individuals effectively.

- **Location Tracking**: Provides real-time tracking of the elderly person's location, ensuring safety and timely assistance.

## Technology_Stack

- **Mobile Sensors**: Gyroscope, Accelerometer
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trained models for activity classification and fall detection.
- **API Integration**: Handles data storage, authentication, and notifications to caregivers.
